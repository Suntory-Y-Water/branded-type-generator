# Branded Type Generator

This project is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite. It provides a tool to generate branded types (commonly known as "nominal types") to add more type safety in TypeScript. 

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Run development server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Open your browser at http://localhost:5173 (by default).
4. Input CSV or Tab-separated type data (e.g. `id, number`) and click **Generate**.
